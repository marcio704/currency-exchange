# currency-exchange
A groovy on grails + Angular JS application which basically warns you via chat when some currency value is changing in some proportion. 

For instance, when US Dolar to Brazilian Real grows 10% a message will be sent to your user via Hipchat.

It also offers an index page where you can get the exchange value between two different coins. 

All the conversions are made using the Mashape Currency Api.
